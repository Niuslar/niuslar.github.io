I am Nicolás Uslar Miano, an Industrial Civil Engineer from Chile with an MSc in Sustainable 
Energy Systems from Queen Mary, University of London. 
The focus of my masters thesis was about the stability of emerging photovoltaic technologies 
on indoor spaces. The main use of these technologies is IoT devices, which led me to discover the 
world of embedded systems. 

Since then, I have taken many different courses on different topics, like Embedded C, Peripherals drivers development, Networking and more. 
Currently I am learning about Operating Systems with the book "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces". 
In parallel I am taking an online course on FreeRTOS. 

My goal is to be comfortable with Bare Metal Programming, Embedded Linux and FreeRTOS in order to 
be able to create a wide range of projects with a main focus on IoT devices. 

If you want to know more about me, please feel free to send me an e-mail to uslarnicolas@gmail.com or visit 
my LinkedIn or Github pages which can be found at the bottom of this page. 

Thanks for stopping by! 

Nicolás
