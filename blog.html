                        <p>
                            After several months of working on personal projects, I set myself the task of finding a project where I could work and learn as part of a team. 
                            That’s when I found a team of engineers developing an incubator for laboratories. After a quick call with one of the embedded engineers, I was assigned the task of helping in developing a temperature control system. 
                        </p>
                        <div class="read_more" id="show_more">
                        <h2>The goal of the project</h2>
                        <p>The main goal of this project was to create a temperature control system to keep a 
                            constant temperature in an incubator. The project is based on an STM32 microcontroller and some of the main  features include:
                        </p>
                        <li>10 ADC Channels for temperature reading</li>
                        <li>4 ADC Channels for telemetry</li>
                        <li>UART for logging and debugging </li>
                        <li>PWM output for heaters and coolers</li> 
                        <li>PID Control to regulate PWM output</li>
                        <p>
                            To date, all these features are ready and waiting for some real world testing once the custom PCB is finished. 
                            During the course of this project, I have learnt not only about embedded systems, but also about solving problems and team work.    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here’s a bit of my main contributions, the main challenges I faced and the lessons I learnt.
                        </p>
                        <h2>From C to C++</h2>
                        <p>
                            When I first started this project, I was given the choice of using C or C++. I chose C because I had used it for all my previous projects and I had never had any problems with it. 
                            After a couple of months of working with C, the project started to get bigger than initially expected and the advantages of using an object-oriented programming language were becoming obvious. 
                            While I still like C because of its simplicity compared to C++, I have really enjoyed working with all the features C++ offers.                            
                        </p>
                        <h2>Reading ADC Channels</h2>
                        <p>
                            One of the first things I started working on was reading the data from the multiple ADC channels and converting it to voltage. To do this, I used a circular buffer and DMA. The main challenge of this part was finding a bug that wasn’t part of the code I had written, but from the STM32 auto-generated code. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            STM32 has a very easy-to-use GUI to configure the hardware and it auto-generates the relevant code. For some reason, this code had a bug that prevented DMA from working properly when using it with ADC. 
                            This made me realise that I need to be careful when using GUIs that generate the code for me.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Setting up hardware and software timers</h2>
                        <p>
                            When we started the project we had a small microcontroller that didn’t have enough pins that supported hardware PWM, so we had to use a few GPIO to simulate PWM using interrupts. Apart from learning more about timers and PWM, the main lesson I got from writing this module was to always refer to the data sheet and reference manual when something is not working as expected.
                            When checking the timers with a logic analyser, I noticed that the numbers in the code did not match what was being generated by the pin. That’s when I saw in the development board’s data sheet that the 8MHz crystal present was not being used for the main microcontroller, but for the debugging interface. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>UART Communication</h2>
                        <p>
                            After writing the code to read ADC inputs and control the PWM pins, one important feature that we needed was a way to communicate with the microcontroller. 
                            This would be used to send messages from the MCU to a terminal and to send commands to the MCU for debugging. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to achieve this, I wrote the following modules:</p>
                        <li>FIFO Buffer to store incoming/outgoing data</li>
                        <li>JSON-based parser to process commands</li>
                        <h2>FIFO Buffer</h2> 
                        <p>
                            While C++ has std::queues to implement FIFO buffers easily, I wanted to write my own template class as a learning experience. 
                            One of the main problems I faced with this buffer was an error in the data received when I sent data via UART very quickly. This was caused by a race condition generated when an interrupt handler and the main program were accessing the buffer at the same time. To solve this, I opted to disable interrupts while the buffer was busy. 
                            While this could cause a delay in the data transfer, this was too small to make any difference.
                        </p>
                        <h2>JSON-based parser</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is another feature that could have been easily added by using third-party libraries. However, my goal was to learn as much as I could, so I wrote my own JSON-based parser to process incoming commands. 
                            To achieve this, I divided the parser into two parts: a tokeniser and the actual parser. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The job of the tokeniser is to process the strings coming from the communications channel, in order to obtain tokens and then store the tokens in a buffer. A token, in this case, is the basic building block of a JSON string. These are: curly braces, square brackets, colon, commas, strings and numbers. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With all the tokens in the buffer, the parser processes them using recursive functions to identify if the string is a JSON string and if it has the right components. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Writing this parser was more challenging than I expected, and it helped me understand better how to use state machines and recursive functions. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>Setting up HIL Testing</h2>
                        <p>
                            With most of the code in a working state, I decided to learn a bit more about DevOps and set up Hardware in the loop testing using a Raspberry Pi and a Nucleo-64 board. 
                            One of the engineers in the team had already set up a Github Action to check the application would build successfully using docker. This process generates a binary file that was very useful for setting up HIL. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first step was to flash the STM32 using the Raspberry Pi. To do this, I wrote a Python script that used the pre-loaded bootloader in the STM32 to download the code using UART. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once I checked this script worked correctly, it was time to connect the Raspberry Pi to Github. 
                            The first part was to set up the Raspberry Pi as a self-hosted runner, which meant Github could use it to run jobs every time a merge request was created. 
                            The next step was to define the workflow to do the following: 
                        </p>
                        <li>Each time a merge request is created, a job would check the program builds successfully and generate a .bin file. </li>
                        <li>If the previous step was successful, download the file onto the raspberry pi and load it into the STM32 using the custom Python script. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the STM32 was flashed successfully, a series of tests using Pytest can be run. 
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            Doing this was a very interesting and challenging experience, and I am now in the process of writing the tests for the STM32. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Working with this team has been an invaluable experience. Sharing ideas, giving and receiving feedback and discussing things in a constructive way has helped me become a better embedded engineer and I can’t wait to see what the future holds.
